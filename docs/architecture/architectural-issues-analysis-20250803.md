## Issue #5: Class Management Integration Issues

### **Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ High

### **File Affected**

- `/src/base/mixins/ClassManagerMixin.ts`

### **Problem Description**

Tight coupling with AttributeManagerMixin, abstract methods that throw errors, and unclear usage patterns.

### **Technical Issues**

- Requires AttributeManagerMixin dependency
- Abstract methods throw runtime errors instead of compile-time enforcement
- Unclear integration points with other mixins

### **Impact**

- Forced coupling reduces flexibility
- Runtime errors instead of compile-time safety
- Difficult to use mixin independently
- Unclear usage patterns for developers

### **Resolution Strategy**
