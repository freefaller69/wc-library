# ADR-001: Phased Component Development Strategy

## Status

**Accepted** - 2025-08-01

## Context

We are building a comprehensive web component library with sophisticated mixin-based architecture. The library needs to scale from basic primitives to complex organisms while maintaining code quality, performance, and accessibility standards.

### Key Challenges

1. **Architecture Validation**: How do we validate that our mixin composition patterns scale across different component types?
2. **Pattern Extraction**: When should we extract reusable patterns versus building component-specific solutions?
3. **Performance Optimization**: How do we ensure our architecture remains performant as complexity grows?
4. **Development Focus**: How do we maintain focus while building a comprehensive component library?

### Alternative Approaches Considered

#### Option 1: Complete Library First, Optimize Later

**Approach**: Build all planned components quickly, then optimize the entire system.

- ‚úÖ Fast initial progress
- ‚ùå Risk of architectural debt
- ‚ùå Difficult to change patterns after widespread adoption
- ‚ùå Performance issues discovered too late

#### Option 2: Perfect Architecture First

**Approach**: Design the complete architecture upfront, then implement components.

- ‚úÖ Theoretically optimal architecture
- ‚ùå Risk of over-engineering without real-world validation
- ‚ùå Slow progress on deliverable components
- ‚ùå Patterns may not match actual usage

#### Option 3: Phased Evidence-Based Development (Chosen)

**Approach**: Build components in strategic phases, collecting architectural evidence to inform optimization.

- ‚úÖ Architecture validated with real components
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based optimization decisions
- ‚úÖ Manageable complexity growth
- ‚úÖ Clear progress milestones

## Decision

We will implement a **3-Phase Component Development Strategy** that builds architectural evidence through systematic component implementation.

### Phase 1: Core Primitives Portfolio

**Objective**: Validate mixin composition patterns with diverse primitive components

**Components**:

- ‚úÖ `ui-button` (interactive, events, state management)
- üîÑ `ui-input` (complex attributes, validation, keyboard navigation)
- üîÑ `ui-select` (advanced interaction, accessibility, event coordination)
- üîÑ `ui-checkbox` (boolean states, custom styling, form integration)

**Evidence Collection**:

- Mixin integration effectiveness
- Performance characteristics of composed components
- Common patterns across primitive implementations
- Accessibility integration success

### Phase 2: Molecule Components

**Objective**: Validate component composition and communication patterns

**Components**:

- üîÑ `ui-form-field` (multi-component composition, state coordination)
- üîÑ `ui-card` (layout flexibility, content projection)

**Evidence Collection**:

- Inter-component communication effectiveness
- Slot management patterns
- Performance impact of composite components
- Reusable composition strategies

### Phase 3: Architecture Optimization & Tooling

**Objective**: Optimize architecture based on collected evidence

**Deliverables**:

- Performance monitoring integration (Performance API + Playwright)
- Enhanced mixin communication patterns
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Advanced testing utilities and development tooling

## Rationale

### Why This Approach Works

#### 1. Evidence-Based Architecture

Building multiple components before optimizing patterns provides real-world validation of architectural decisions. This prevents premature optimization and ensures patterns scale with actual usage.

**Example**: Button component validates basic mixin composition, while input component tests complex attribute management. Both provide evidence for optimization decisions.

#### 2. Manageable Complexity Growth

Each phase builds on the previous phase's learnings, allowing complexity to grow in a controlled manner. This prevents architectural overwhelm and maintains code quality.

**Example**: Phase 1 establishes mixin patterns; Phase 2 validates composition strategies; Phase 3 optimizes based on evidence.

#### 3. Clear Success Metrics

Each phase has specific success criteria that validate architectural decisions before moving to the next phase.

**Example**: Phase 1 complete when 4 primitives demonstrate consistent patterns and performance baseline is established.

#### 4. Strategic Focus

The phased approach maintains focus on specific architectural questions while making steady progress on deliverable components.

**Example**: Phase 1 focuses on "Do our mixins compose well?" rather than trying to solve all architectural questions simultaneously.

### Architectural Principles Validated

#### Mixin-First Composition

```typescript
const ButtonComponent = compose(
  CoreCustomElement,
  ShadowDOMMixin,
  StyleManagerMixin,
  AttributeManagerMixin,
  EventManagerMixin,
  AccessibilityMixin
);
```

Each primitive component validates different aspects of mixin composition, building evidence for the effectiveness of this pattern.

#### Accessibility-First Design

Using transparent wrapper patterns with native element delegation ensures components enhance rather than replace native browser capabilities.

#### Semantic HTML Foundation

Leveraging native browser capabilities versus reimplementation provides better performance and accessibility while reducing implementation complexity.

## Implementation Strategy

### Quality Gates

- **Phase Completion**: Specific success criteria must be met before advancing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous measurement prevents performance regressions
- **Code Quality**: Automated quality gates (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript)
- **Documentation**: Each phase updates architectural documentation with evidence

### Risk Mitigation

- **Scope Creep**: Phased approach maintains focus on specific objectives
- **Architecture Drift**: Evidence collection prevents unvalidated changes
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous monitoring catches issues early
- **Quality Debt**: Built-in quality requirements prevent technical debt accumulation

### Success Metrics

#### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- [ ] 4 core primitives implemented with consistent patterns
- [ ] Mixin composition patterns validated across component types
- [ ] Performance baseline established (<2ms initialization per component)
- [ ] Accessibility patterns proven (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

#### Phase 2 Success Criteria

- [ ] 2 molecule components demonstrate effective primitive composition
- [ ] Component communication patterns documented and validated
- [ ] Slot management strategies proven effective
- [ ] Performance impact of composite components measured and acceptable

#### Phase 3 Success Criteria

- [ ] Performance monitoring system operational with real-time metrics
- [ ] Architecture optimizations implemented based on collected evidence
- [ ] Advanced development tooling reduces friction measurably
- [ ] Library ready for production adoption with full documentation

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Validated Architecture**: Patterns proven with real component implementations
- **Controlled Complexity**: Manageable growth prevents architectural overwhelm
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Optimization based on real usage data
- **Clear Progress**: Tangible milestones demonstrate advancement
- **Quality Focus**: Built-in quality gates prevent technical debt

### Potential Challenges

- **Slower Initial Progress**: Building evidence takes time before optimization
- **Pattern Changes**: Early patterns may need refinement based on evidence
- **Complexity Management**: Keeping track of evidence and patterns requires discipline

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Documentation Requirements**: Each phase must document architectural learnings
- **Pattern Evolution**: Accept that patterns will evolve based on evidence
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic architecture reviews ensure lessons are captured

## Related Decisions

- **Component Architecture**: Documented in `/docs/architecture/component-architecture-guide.md`
- **Mixin Patterns**: Detailed in existing mixin documentation
- **Quality Standards**: Defined in code review and testing guidelines

## Review Schedule

This decision will be reviewed after each phase completion to assess effectiveness and make adjustments based on collected evidence.
