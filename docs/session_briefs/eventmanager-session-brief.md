# Claude Code Session Brief: EventManagerMixin Refinement

## Current Problem

EventManagerMixin is functional but could benefit from improvements in event naming consistency, listener management, and developer experience features.

## Session Goal

Refine ONLY the EventManagerMixin - no other mixins, no integration changes.

## What NOT to Change

- CoreCustomElement base class
- ShadowDOMMixin (perfect as-is)
- StyleManagerMixin (perfect as-is)
- Mixin-composer utility
- Any other existing code

## Required Deliverables

1. Enhanced EventManagerMixin only
2. Unit tests for EventManagerMixin
3. Simple integration test with CoreCustomElement

## Current Implementation Analysis

The existing EventManagerMixin has:

- Basic custom event dispatching
- Automatic event name prefixing (`ui-${tagName}-${eventName}`)
- Good default options (bubbles, cancelable, composed)

## Areas for Enhancement

### 1. Event Listener Management

Consider adding methods for:

```typescript
interface EventManagerMixinInterface {
  dispatchCustomEvent(eventName: string, detail?: unknown, options?: CustomEventInit): boolean;
  // Potential additions:
  addComponentListener(
    eventName: string,
    handler: EventListener,
    options?: AddEventListenerOptions
  ): void;
  removeComponentListener(eventName: string, handler: EventListener): void;
  removeAllComponentListeners(): void;
}
```

### 2. Event Name Consistency

- Should the `ui-${tagName}-` prefix be configurable?
- Consider a helper for consistent event naming
- Maybe support both prefixed and unprefixed events?

### 3. Lifecycle Integration

- Should event listeners be cleaned up automatically on disconnect?
- Add disconnectedCallback integration if needed

### 4. Developer Experience

- Event name constants or helpers?
- Better TypeScript support for event details?
- Debug logging for development?

## Architecture Decisions Needed

### Event Naming Strategy

```javascript
// Current: 'ui-my-button-click'
// Alternative: 'my-button:click' or just 'click'
// Should this be configurable per component?
```

### Listener Cleanup

```javascript
// Should the mixin track listeners and auto-cleanup?
// Or leave that to the component developer?
```

### Event Detail Typing

```javascript
// Should we support typed event details?
// dispatchCustomEvent<T>(eventName: string, detail?: T): boolean
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility with existing dispatchCustomEvent
- [ ] Adds useful listener management if beneficial
- [ ] Improves developer experience without overengineering
- [ ] Has comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Works with CoreCustomElement in integration test
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing interface

## Example Usage Goals

```javascript
class ButtonComponent extends compose(CoreCustomElement, EventManagerMixin) {
  handleClick() {
    // Current works, should continue working
    this.dispatchCustomEvent('click', { timestamp: Date.now() });

    // Potential enhancements:
    this.addComponentListener('focus', this.handleFocus);
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    super.disconnectedCallback?.();
    // Should listeners be auto-cleaned up?
  }
}
```

## Questions to Consider

1. Is automatic listener cleanup worth the complexity?
2. Should event naming be more flexible/configurable?
3. Are there common event patterns worth supporting?
4. What would make the developer experience significantly better?

## Context to Provide Claude Code

- Current EventManagerMixin implementation
- CoreCustomElement implementation
- Mixin-composer utility
- Explanation that this mixin should stay focused and lean
- Emphasis on developer experience improvements

## Validation Steps

1. Ensure existing dispatchCustomEvent still works exactly the same
2. Test any new listener management features
3. Verify no memory leaks from unremoved listeners
4. Check that integration with other mixins is unaffected
5. Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
