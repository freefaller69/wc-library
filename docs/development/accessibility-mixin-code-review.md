## Review Categories

### 🔴 CRITICAL Issues

**None Found** - A rare achievement for a comprehensive feature implementation.

### 🟡 WARNINGS (3 items)

#### W1. Potential Memory Accumulation in ID Generation

- **File**: `src/utilities/accessibility.ts:5`
- **Issue**: Module-scoped `idCounter` never resets, potential integer overflow in very long-running applications
- **Recommendation**: Consider `crypto.randomUUID()` or reset mechanism
- **Priority**: Low (affects only extremely long-lived applications)

#### W2. Live Region Cleanup Edge Case

- **File**: `src/base/mixins/AccessibilityMixin.ts:417-428`
- **Issue**: Cleanup doesn't verify region ownership, could affect other component instances
- **Recommendation**: Add instance-specific identifiers or stricter ownership tracking
- **Priority**: Medium (potential multi-component interference)

#### W3. Abstract Method Documentation

- **File**: `src/base/mixins/AccessibilityMixin.ts:152`
- **Issue**: `getAccessibilityConfig()` lacks comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- **Recommendation**: Add detailed JSDoc with required vs. optional configuration examples
- **Priority**: Low (developer experience improvement)

### 💡 SUGGESTIONS (5 items)

#### S1. Enhanced Type Safety for ARIA Values

- **Enhancement**: Create typed ARIA value enums (e.g., `aria-invalid: 'true' | 'false' | 'grammar' | 'spelling'`)
- **Benefit**: Compile-time validation of ARIA attribute values
- **Effort**: Medium

#### S2. Performance Optimization for Relationship Validation

- **Enhancement**: Debounce `validatePendingRelationships()` method
- **Benefit**: Reduce excessive DOM queries during rapid updates
- **Effort**: Low

#### S3. Accessibility Utility Integration

- **Enhancement**: Expose `FocusManager` utility through the mixin
- **Benefit**: Advanced focus management capabilities for components
- **Effort**: Medium

#### S4. Enhanced Error Context

- **Enhancement**: Include component identifiers in error messages
- **Benefit**: Improved debugging in applications with many similar components
- **Effort**: Low

#### S5. Live Region Pooling

- **Enhancement**: Global live region pool to reduce DOM overhead
- **Benefit**: Performance optimization for applications with many announcing components
- **Effort**: High
