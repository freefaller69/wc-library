# Strategic Component Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our **3-Phase Component Development Strategy** for building a comprehensive web component library. Our approach emphasizes evidence-based architecture, mixin-first composition, and accessibility-first design to create a scalable, maintainable component ecosystem.

## Strategic Philosophy

### Evidence-Based Architecture

Build multiple components before optimizing patterns. Each primitive component provides architectural evidence that informs framework improvements. This prevents premature optimization and ensures our patterns scale with real-world usage.

### Mixin-First Composition

Leverage the mixin-composer utilities for clean component inheritance. This approach promotes code reuse, maintains separation of concerns, and provides consistent behavior across components.

### Accessibility-First Design

Use transparent wrapper patterns with native element delegation. This ensures our components enhance rather than replace native browser capabilities, maintaining semantic HTML foundations.

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Architecture

**Principle**: Build components first, optimize patterns second.

**Implementation**:

- Each primitive component serves as architectural evidence
- Patterns are extracted after multiple implementations
- Optimization decisions based on real usage data

**Example**: Button component validates mixin composition; input component validates attribute management; select component validates keyboard navigation patterns.

### 2. Mixin-First Composition

**Principle**: Leverage mixin-composer utilities for clean inheritance.

**Implementation**:

```typescript
const ButtonComponent = compose(
  CoreCustomElement,
  AccessibilityMixin,
  AttributeManagerMixin,
  StyleHandlerMixin // Current mixin for styling (StyleManagerMixin was removed)
);
```

**Benefits**: Code reuse, separation of concerns, consistent behavior

### 3. Accessibility-First Design

**Principle**: Enhance native capabilities rather than replacing them.

**Implementation**:

- Transparent wrapper patterns
- Native element delegation
- ARIA enhancement, not replacement
- Semantic HTML foundation

**Example**: Button wraps `<button>` element; input enhances `<input>` element

### 4. Semantic HTML Foundation

**Principle**: Leverage native browser capabilities vs reimplementation.

**Implementation**:

- Native elements provide base functionality
- Custom elements add styling and behavior
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Graceful degradation support
