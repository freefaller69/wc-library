# Future Enhancements and Deferred Tasks

This document tracks enhancement suggestions and deferred tasks for future implementation phases.

## Code Review Suggestions (Deferred)

### AttributeManagerMixin Enhancements (PR #15)

**Status**: Merged - Production Ready  
**Review Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Reviewer Assessment**: ✅ READY FOR MERGE - Excellent

#### Deferred Improvements:

1. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - **File**: `src/base/mixins/AttributeManagerMixin.ts` (lines 36-45)
   - **Task**: Add JSDoc usage examples to `getObservedAttributes()` function
   - **Timing**: After mixin refactoring phase is complete
   - **Rationale**: Avoid documentation churn during active refactoring

2. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - **Files**: `src/test/AttributeManagerMixin.test.ts`, `src/test/AttributeManagerMixin.integration.test.ts`
   - **Task**: Enable skipped DOM integration tests (8 tests currently skipped)
   - **Timing**: After Playwright setup and primitive components are complete
   - **Requirements**: Playwright testing environment, completed primitives for real DOM testing

3. **Interface Location Review**
   - **File**: `src/base/mixins/AttributeManagerMixin.ts` (lines 14-21)
   - **Task**: Review if `ClassManagerInterface` and `UpdateManagerInterface` should move to shared types
   - **Timing**: After all mixin refactoring is complete
   - **Decision Criteria**: If other mixins need similar type guard patterns

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Mixin Refactoring (Current)

- [ ] Complete all mixin enhancements to gold star status
- [x] AttributeManagerMixin ✅

### Phase 2: Composites Review

- [ ] Update composites if needed based on mixin changes
- [ ] Validate composite patterns work with enhanced mixins

- [ ] Complete a few primitive components
- [ ] Validate real-world usage patterns

### Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up Playwright testing environment
- [ ] Re-enable skipped DOM integration tests
- [ ] Comprehensive end-to-end testing

### Phase 5: Documentation & Architecture Review

- [ ] Add JSDoc examples to enhanced mixins
- [ ] Review shared type interface locations
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation updates
