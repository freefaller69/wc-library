# Breaking Changes Policy

> **Historical Document Notice** (Updated August 5, 2025): This document outlined a planned gradual deprecation process for BaseComponent/ShadowComponent that was never implemented. Instead, these legacy components were completely removed in August 2025 as part of architectural evolution. This document is preserved for historical reference but does not reflect the actual transition process that occurred.
>
> **Current Reality**: The project moved directly to the current architecture with two patterns: build-from-scratch (UI Heading) and mixin composition (UI Button). No compatibility layer was maintained.

## Historical Overview

This document outlined the planned policy for managing breaking changes during the mixin refactoring and future development of the web component library. The actual transition took a different approach than described below.

## Refactoring Timeline

### Phase 1: Parallel Development (Weeks 1-4)

**Status**: No breaking changes
**Duration**: 4 weeks
**Approach**: Build new system alongside existing system

#### What's Happening

- New mixin system developed in parallel
- Existing `BaseComponent` and `ShadowComponent` remain unchanged
- All existing components continue working normally
- New system available for opt-in testing

#### Guarantees

- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ All existing components work unchanged
- ✅ No API modifications
- ✅ No behavioral changes
- ✅ Full backward compatibility

```typescript
// Both systems coexist
import { BaseComponent } from './base/BaseComponent.js'; // Existing - unchanged
import { InteractiveComponent } from './base/composites/InteractiveComponent.js'; // New - opt-in
```

### Phase 2: Soft Migration (Weeks 5-8)

**Status**: Deprecation warnings only
**Duration**: 4 weeks
**Approach**: Encourage migration with deprecation notices

#### What's Happening

- Add deprecation warnings to old base classes
- Update documentation to recommend new system
- Provide migration guides and tooling
- Begin migrating internal components as examples
- Performance benchmarks published

#### Guarantees

- ✅ No breaking changes - everything still works
- ⚠️ Deprecation warnings in console (non-breaking)
- ✅ Migration guides and tools available
- ✅ Side-by-side performance comparisons

```typescript
// Deprecation warning example (non-breaking)
export class BaseComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor(config: ComponentConfig) {
    super();

    // Non-breaking deprecation warning
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      console.warn(
        `BaseComponent is deprecated. Please migrate to mixin-based components. 
         See: docs/development/component-migration-guide.md`
      );
    }

    // All existing functionality remains unchanged
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Active Migration (Weeks 9-12)

**Status**: Planned breaking changes with major version bump
**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Approach**: Major version release with breaking changes

#### What's Happening

- Major version bump (v2.0.0)
- Remove deprecated `BaseComponent` and `ShadowComponent`
- Update all internal components to use mixins
- Update default exports to new system
- Provide clear migration path

#### Breaking Changes

- ❌ `BaseComponent` class removed
- ❌ `ShadowComponent` class removed
- ❌ Old composite interfaces may change
- ✅ New mixin system is the default
- ✅ All functionality preserved in new system

### Phase 4: Stabilization (Weeks 13-16)

**Status**: New system stabilizes  
**Duration**: 4 weeks
**Approach**: Bug fixes and optimization

#### What's Happening

- Address any migration issues discovered
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- Community feedback integration

## Semantic Versioning Strategy

### Version Numbering

Following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (remove old base classes)
- **MINOR**: New mixins, new composite classes, new features
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, non-breaking changes

### Current Plan

```
v1.x.x → v2.0.0
├── v1.0.0 - Current stable (BaseComponent/ShadowComponent)
├── v1.1.0 - Add mixin system (parallel, non-breaking)
├── v1.2.0 - Add deprecation warnings (non-breaking)
├── v1.3.0 - Final v1.x release with migration tools
├──
└── v2.0.0 - BREAKING: Remove old base classes, mixin-only
    ├── v2.0.1 - Bug fixes
    ├── v2.1.0 - New mixins/features
    └── v2.x.x - Continued development
```

## Communication Strategy

### Advance Notice Requirements

#### 8 Weeks Before Breaking Changes

- **Announce intent** in documentation and release notes
- **Publish migration guide** with detailed instructions
- **Release parallel implementation** for early adopters
- **Set up feedback channels** for migration issues

#### 4 Weeks Before Breaking Changes

- **Release candidate** with breaking changes for testing
- **Final migration tools** and automated helpers
- **Update all examples** to use new system
- **Community outreach** and support

#### 1 Week Before Breaking Changes

- **Final warning** in release notes
- **Confirm migration path** is well-documented
- **Support resources** ready for release day

### Communication Channels

```typescript
// 1. Code-level warnings
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.warn('⚠️ DEPRECATION: BaseComponent will be removed in v2.0.0');
  console.info('📚 Migration guide: docs/development/component-migration-guide.md');
  console.info('🔄 Migration tool: npm run migrate-component');
}

// 2. Package.json deprecation notice
{
  "name": "web-component-library",
  "version": "1.3.0",
  "deprecated": false,
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=16.0.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    // Clear dependency requirements
  }
}

// 3. TypeScript deprecation annotations
/**
 * @deprecated Use InteractiveComponent or compose mixins directly
 * Will be removed in v2.0.0
 * @see docs/development/component-migration-guide.md
 */
export class BaseComponent extends HTMLElement {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Migration Support

### Automated Migration Tools

```bash
# Command-line migration tool
npx web-component-migrate analyze    # Analyze current usage
npx web-component-migrate plan       # Generate migration plan
npx web-component-migrate execute    # Execute migration
```

### Migration Path Documentation

Each breaking change includes:

- **What's changing**: Clear description of the change
- **Why it's changing**: Reasoning and benefits
- **How to migrate**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Code examples**: Before/after code samples
- **Validation**: How to verify the migration worked

## Breaking Change: BaseComponent Removal

### What's Changing

The `BaseComponent` class is being removed in v2.0.0.

### Why

- 50% smaller bundle sizes for simple components
- Better performance through tree-shaking
- More flexible composition patterns

### How to Migrate

BEFORE (v1.x):

```typescript
import { BaseComponent } from 'web-component-library';

class MyComponent extends BaseComponent {
  constructor() {
    super({ tagName: 'my-component' });
  }
}
```
````

AFTER (v2.x):

```typescript
import { InteractiveComponent } from 'web-component-library';

class MyComponent extends InteractiveComponent {
  constructor() {
    super({ tagName: 'my-component' });
  }
}
```

### Validation

Run `npm run test:migration` to verify your migration.

````

## Rollback Strategy

### Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered after breaking changes:

#### Immediate Response (< 24 hours)
```bash
# Emergency patch release
v2.0.1 - Hotfix critical issues
v2.0.2 - Additional fixes if needed
````

#### Short-term Fallback (< 1 week)

```typescript
// Provide compatibility layer in emergency patch
export { BaseComponentCompat as BaseComponent } from './compat/BaseComponentCompat.js';

// BaseComponentCompat provides same API but uses new mixin system internally
class BaseComponentCompat extends FullComponent {
  // Bridge implementation
}
```

#### Long-term Support

- Maintain v1.x LTS branch for critical security fixes
- Provide extended migration support period
- Clear timeline for compatibility layer removal

## Breaking Change Types

### Major Breaking Changes (Require Major Version)

- Remove public classes/interfaces
- Change public method signatures
- Remove public properties
- Change default behaviors
- Remove package exports

### Minor Breaking Changes (Can be Minor Version with Deprecation)

- Add required parameters with defaults
- Change internal implementations (if documented as internal)
- Stricter TypeScript types
- Performance optimizations that change timing

### Non-Breaking Changes (Patch/Minor Version)

- Add new optional parameters
- Add new methods/properties
- Fix bugs that restore intended behavior
- Internal refactoring
- Performance improvements

## User Impact Assessment

### Impact Levels

#### High Impact (Requires Immediate Action)

- Public API removals
- Changed method signatures
- Required configuration changes
- Build process changes

#### Medium Impact (Requires Planning)

- Deprecation warnings
- Performance characteristic changes
- New recommended patterns
- Optional parameter additions

#### Low Impact (Minimal Action Required)

- Internal refactoring
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- New optional features

### Risk Mitigation

```typescript
// 1. Backwards compatibility validation
describe('Backwards Compatibility', () => {
  it('should maintain API compatibility across versions', () => {
    // Automated API compatibility testing
  });
});

// 2. Performance regression testing
describe('Performance Regression', () => {
  it('should not regress performance by more than 5%', () => {
    // Automated performance testing
  });
});

// 3. Migration validation
describe('Migration Validation', () => {
  it('should successfully migrate all example components', () => {
    // Test migration tooling
  });
});
```

## Future Breaking Change Policy

### Principles

1. **Minimize breaking changes** - Always look for backward-compatible solutions first
2. **Bundle related changes** - Group breaking changes into major releases
3. **Provide migration paths** - Never leave users stranded
4. **Communicate early and often** - Give users time to plan
5. **Support the transition** - Provide tools and assistance

### Regular Review Process

- **Quarterly assessment** of potential breaking changes
- **Annual major release planning** for accumulated breaking changes
- **Continuous feedback** collection from users
- **Regular communication** about future plans

This policy ensures that breaking changes are managed responsibly, with clear communication, adequate notice, and comprehensive support for users during transitions.
